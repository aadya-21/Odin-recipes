    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Instructions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Get ready to ignite your taste buds! In a glass jar or bottle, combine the apple cider vinegar, chopped
            onion, minced garlic, grated horseradish, grated ginger, sliced chili peppers, and lemon zest.</li>
        <li>If you're feeling adventurous, add any additional herbs or spices of your choice. This is where you can
            customize your fire cider and make it truly unique.</li>
        <li>Give everything a good stir to make sure all the ingredients are well combined. Imagine you're stirring up a
            magical potion!</li>
        <li>Seal the jar tightly with a lid and let it sit in a cool, dark place for 2-4 weeks. During this time, the
            flavors will meld together and create a fiery concoction.</li>
        <li>After the waiting period, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth into a clean jar or
            bottle. Squeeze out all the goodness from the solids.</li>
        <li>Now, you have your potent fire cider base! At this point, you can add a tablespoon of raw honey if you
            prefer a touch of sweetness and extra immune-boosting properties. Stir it in until well combined.</li>
        <li>Store your fire cider in the refrigerator, where it will remain potent and fiery for several months. It's
            like having a secret weapon against cold and flu season!</li>
        <li>Whenever you're in need of a boost, take a tablespoon or two of your fire cider elixir. You can drink it
            straight or dilute it with a little water or juice if it's too intense for your taste buds.</li>
        <li>Feel the warmth and power of the fire cider course through your body, invigorating your senses and giving
            your immune system a kick.</li>
        <li>Share the recipe with friends and family who seek an extra fiery kick in their lives. Spread the fire cider
            love!</li>
