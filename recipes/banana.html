    <p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 really ripe bananas (the spottier, the better!)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of pure magic (also known as melted unsalted butter)</li>
        <li>1 cup of sugar (for a touch of sweetness)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs (because we need some company in this bread party)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (because vanilla makes everything better)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour (the secret to fluffy goodness)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of baking soda (to make it rise like a champion)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt (just a pinch to enhance the flavors)/li>
        <li>1/2 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans (optional, but adds nutty awesomeness)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Instructions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat your oven to a toasty 350°F (175°C). Get it all warmed up for the banana bread extravaganza!</li>
        <li>Take those ripe bananas and give them a good old mash with a fork or a potato masher. Show 'em who's boss!
        </li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, grab that melted butter and introduce it to the sugar. Mix them together until they
            become the best of friends.</li>
        <li>Now, let's bring in the eggs, one at a time, and whisk away. Give them a grand entrance, like they're
            walking the red carpet!</li>
        <li>Time to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Vanilla is like the fairy godmother of flavors, making everything
            magical.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and just a pinch of salt. They'll form
            the dream team of dry ingredients.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the dry mixture into the wet mixture. Stir gently until they all mingle and become one glorious
            batter. No need to rush, we're creating a masterpiece here!</li>
        <li>If you're feeling nutty (literally), go ahead and add those chopped walnuts or pecans to the party. They add
            a delightful crunch.</li>
        <li>Grab your favorite loaf pan and give it a little love by greasing it or lining it with parchment paper. We
            want this bread to slide out like a boss later!</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the pan, spreading it around like a comfy blanket for your future deliciousness.</li>
        <li>Pop that pan into the preheated oven and set your timer for 60-70 minutes. Now, dance around the kitchen and
            enjoy the sweet aroma filling the air!</li>
        <li>When the time's up, insert a toothpick into the center of the bread. If it comes out clean, your masterpiece
            is ready! If not, give it a few more minutes to reach perfection.</li>
        <li>Take the bread out of the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. It's like a cozy nap time
            for your bread.</li>
        <li>Take the bread out of the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. It's like a cozy nap time
