    <p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour (for a fluffy cake texture)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar (for a touch of sweetness)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder (to make it rise like a sunbeam)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda (for a little extra lift)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (just a pinch to enhance the flavors)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (for a creamy dreamy texture)</li>
        <li>3 large eggs (because we need some egg-cellent company)</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk (for moist perfection)</li>
        <li>Zest of 2 lemons (to infuse the cake with zingy goodness)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (to add a burst of citrus flavor)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">For the Lemon Glaze:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar (for a sweet finishing touch)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (to make it tangy and irresistible)</li>
        <li>Additional lemon zest for garnish (because we love that extra zing)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Instructions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). It's time to get this lemony party started!</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Give them a little whisk
            and let them mingle.</li>
        <li>Add the softened butter to the dry mixture and mix until it becomes crumbly. You can use a mixer or go old
            school with a fork.</li>
        <li>Crack in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Imagine you're adding drops of sunshine to
            the batter!</li>
        <li>Pour in the buttermilk, lemon zest, and fresh lemon juice. Mix everything together until you have a smooth
            and velvety batter. Embrace the lemony fragrance!</li>
        <li>Grease and flour a 9-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper. We want the cake to come out with
            ease!</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan, spreading it evenly. Give it a little tap on the counter to
            release any air bubbles and level it out.</li>
        <li>Pop the pan into the preheated oven and let the cake bake for about 30-35 minutes. While it bakes, the
            citrusy aroma will make your kitchen feel like a lemon grove!</li>
        <li>To check if it's done, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean or with a few
            moist crumbs, your lemony creation is ready.</li>
        <li>Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. It needs a moment to gather
            itself before the grand finale.</li>
        <li>While the cake cools, let's whip up a tangy lemon glaze. In a bowl, mix together the powdered sugar and
            fresh lemon juice until smooth and drizzle-worthy.</li>
        <li>Once the cake has cooled slightly, transfer it to a serving plate. Drizzle the lemon glaze over the top,
            letting it cascade down the sides like a lemon waterfall.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle some additional lemon zest on top for an extra pop of lemony goodness and a beautiful garnish.</li>
        <li>Now, it's time for the grand finale! Slice a generous piece of your zesty lemon cake, savor every tangy
            bite, and let the bright flavors dance on your taste buds.</li>
        <li>Share it with loved ones or keep it all to yourself. Either way, you've created a lemony masterpiece to be
            proud of!</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Enjoy the zesty delight of your homemade lemon cake! It's sunshine in every slice.
