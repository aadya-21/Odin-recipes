    <ul>
        <li>Time to muddle! In a sturdy glass, add the fresh mint leaves and granulated sugar. Use a muddler or the back
            of a spoon to gently crush and release the aromatic oils from the mint leaves. Let the minty fragrance fill
            the air!</li>
        <li>Squeeze the juice of the limes into the glass. The zesty lime juice will add a tangy kick to your Mojito.
        </li>
        <li>Add the white rum to the glass. Adjust the amount based on your preference for a stronger or milder
            cocktail. Feel free to channel your inner mixologist and experiment!</li>
        <li>Fill the glass with ice cubes, giving it a good stir to combine all the ingredients and chill the mixture.
        </li>
        <li>Top off the glass with club soda to add a refreshing fizz. Pour it slowly to maintain the Mojito's bubbly
            allure.</li>
        <li>Garnish your Lime Mojito with an extra sprig of fresh mint leaves and a lime wedge. It'll make your cocktail
            look even more enticing.</li>
        <li>Grab a straw or a long spoon, and take your first sip of this zesty delight. Let the combination of mint,
            lime, rum, and bubbles transport you to a tropical paradise.</li>
        <li>Savor every sip and imagine yourself lounging on a sunny beach. Feel the cool, citrusy flavors dance on your
            taste buds.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 7 and 8 until your glass is empty or until you've achieved maximum relaxation and enjoyment.
        </li>
        <li>Share the Lime Mojito recipe with friends, and invite them over for a refreshing and lively cocktail hour.
            Cheers to good times and delicious concoctions!</li>

        experimenting with different variations such as using flavored rums or adding fresh fruit like strawberries or
        mangoes. The Mojito is a versatile cocktail that welcomes creativity and personalization. Enjoy the lime-infused
        bliss!
